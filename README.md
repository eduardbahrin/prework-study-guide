# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
This Prework Study Guide is my very first project and part of the prework assigment of the coding bootcamp.

I am very excited to learn and practice more about coding and reach that level where I can start my own business in the future or simply to be part of a great team in a great company.
