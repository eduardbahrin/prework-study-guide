            A string (ie names) need to be contained within quotation marks.
          </li>
          <li>
            As for numbers and Boolean values , quotation marks are not
            necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
            A variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data
            in our code.
          </li>
          <ol>
            <li>To declare a variable, we use the var keyword.</li>
            <li>
              We use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that
              we want stored in our variable.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <li>
            An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.
            Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.
          </li>
          <li>
            Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different
            data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have
            multiple data types.
          </li>
          <li>One array can only contains strings.</li>
          <li>
            A <b>for</b> loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform
            a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block
            to be executed over and over.
          </li>
          <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The first statement determines the starting point for our loop.
              <ul>
                <li>the first index of an array is always 0</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The second statement is the condition.</li>
            <li>
              The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each
              item.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <li>
            Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a
            file.
          </li>
          <li>JavaScript code is executed from top to bottom.</li>
          <li>
            Using conditional statements such as if statements allows us to
            interrupt control flow.
          </li>
          <li>
            An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our
            code. Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code
            will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes we want to provide more conditions than just if. In
            JavaScript, we can have more than one condition by using else if.
          </li>
          <li>
            The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are
            equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and
            false if the values are not equal.
          </li>
